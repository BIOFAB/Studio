BIOFAB Studio is an experimental synthetic biology computer-aided design (CAD) tool based on open web standards (Javascript, HTML 5.0, CSS 3.0). It's a platform for rapid deployment of synthetic biology CAD algorithms being developed at the BIOFAB. This repository will also house the source code for the Data Access Client in anticipation that the Studio and the Data Access Client will eventually merge. The The Data Access Client is the human-centered interface of the BIOFAB's electronic datasheets. It is a rich internet application (RIA) that provides user-friendly access to the design and performance of BIOFAB parts and constructs.
