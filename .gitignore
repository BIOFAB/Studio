# I feel that we should include jar and zip file dependencies
# in order to make hacking on our projects a less painful process
# otherwise people will have to go to several different locations
# and download/compile the needed jar files and then go resolve
# the "mising library reference" issues in netbeans
# If we don't want to include these libraries, then we should
# at least list the exact libraries and download locations
# in the README file.
